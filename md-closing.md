# Limitations

--
## Solidity & EVM
* Implementing integrals and inverse integrals of higher order functions becomes challenging
* Staying within limits of int256 overflows and underflows
* Handling front running of transactions
* Batched processing of transactions within single block - can't guarrantee spot price without slippage

--
## Complex systems

* Complex systems — highly connected networks of semi-independent agents from which system wide patterns emerge—that can learn and adapt over time.
* Human social systems … capable of independent spontaneous, self-organization.
* Agents whose interactions result in self-organization, emergence, and adaptation.

# Patterns and Classification

--
## Static vs. Dynamic

--
## Standards & Composability

## Why?
* Design validation
* Testing robustness
* Finding edge cases
* Finding emergent properties of complex systems
* Performing sensitivity analysis
* Defining system bounds
* Aligning incentives

--
## How?
* Actor model
* cadCAD framework

> a Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems through simulation, with support for Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping

--
## Validation & verification
* cadCAD for validating algorithm design
* formal verification to assert implementation matches the design

## In the wild...
* Coordination mechanisms
* Interfaces
* Configuration spaces
* Funding mechanisms
* Voting
* Composability
* Community currencies & micro-economies

--
* Commons Stack conviction voting
* Molecule markets
* SourceCred
* IXO Impact Bonds

---
## Trends
* Application of engineering methodology
* Introducing more degrees of freedom (e.g. risk-adjusted bonding curves)
* Introducing time as a variable (e.g. conviction voting)
* Using bonding curves as system interfaces (e.g. commons stack)
* Composability of bonding curves within modular systems
