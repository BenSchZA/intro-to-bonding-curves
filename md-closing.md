# Limitations

--
## Solidity & EVM
* Implementing integrals and inverse integrals of higher order functions becomes challenging
* Staying within limits of int256 overflows and underflows
* Handling front running of transactions
* Batched processing of transactions within single block - can't guarrantee spot price without slippage

--
## Functional models?

---
# Patterns and Classification

--
## Static vs. Dynamic

--
## Standards & Composability
* Commons Stack
* BlockScience

---
# Modelling & Simulation
* Testing robustness
* Finding edge cases
* Performing sensitivity analysis
* Defining system bounds

--
## Actor model

--
## Incentive design

--
## cadCAD framework

---
## In the wild...
* Coordination mechanisms
* Interfaces
* Configuration spaces
* Funding mechanisms
* Voting
* Composability
* Community currencies & micro-economies

--
* Commons Stack conviction voting
* Molecule markets
* SourceCred
* IXO Impact Bonds

---
## Trends
* Application of engineering methodology
* Introducing more degrees of freedom (e.g. risk-adjusted bonding curves)
* Introducing time as a variable (e.g. conviction voting)
* Using bonding curves as system interfaces (e.g. commons stack)
* Composability of bonding curves within modular systems
