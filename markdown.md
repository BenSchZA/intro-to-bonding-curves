## A Technical Introduction to Bonding Curves
### For beginners

---
## Who is this for?
* An overview of the technical landscape of bonding curves, for beginners
* Providing context for deeper exploration

---
## Basic Properties
* A function of (at least) token price and supply
* Monotonically increasing
* Deterministic

(We will see variations and extensions of these basic properties, but this is where it all started.)

---
## Misconceptions
* Bonding curves are ponzi schemes
* Bonding curves are for funding, exchanges, & eliminate speculation
* Uniswap is a bonding curve

---
## Background: Scarcity in the digital domain
* Blockchain enables the concept of scarcity
* Solves the double spending problem
* Becomes a source of truth, enables the concept of ownership
* Classic example: apple vs. digital image of apple

--
## Background: Liquidity & microeconomics
* Balance of liquidity and risk; market makers and market takers
* An order book provides liquidity; willing seller & willing buyer
* Dependent on trade volumes

## Terminology

--
## Invariant:
> a property or relationship that remains constant e.g. reserve ratio

--
## Reserve ratio:
> the ratio of the token reserve to token market cap. at a point

``$$
\text{Reserve ratio} = \frac{R}{S*P}
$$``

where R is the reserve, S is the supply, and P is the spot price.

--
* Market cap: market capitalization
* Price sensitivity: the proportionate effect of each token transaction on the spot price
* Collateral: the token held in the reserve
* Reserve: the store of value backing the token supply
* Supply: the tokens issued in exchange for reserve collateral
* Spot price: the token value at a point
* Primitive function: the function describing the relationship between the token price and supply
* Leverage ratio
* Slippage
* Vesting
* Market maker
* Price discovery
* TCR: token curated registry
* Continuous fundraising
* Liquidity

---
## A Design Canvas

---
## Design Parameters
* Time
* Issuance e.g. ERC20, ERC721
* Supply
* Collateral
* Function
* Pricing
* Composition e.g. piecewise

---
## Patterns and Classification

--
## Static vs. Dynamic

---
## Modelling & Simulations
* Testing robustness
* Finding edge cases
* Performing sensitivity analysis
* Defining system bounds

--
## Actor model

--
## Incentive design

--
## cadCAD framework

---
## Limitations

--
## Solidity & EVM
* Implementing integrals and inverse integrals of higher order functions becomes challenging
* Staying within limits of int256 overflows and underflows
* Handling front running of transactions
* Batched processing of transactions within single block - can't guarrantee spot price without slippage

---
## In the wild...
* Coordination mechanisms
* Interfaces
* Configuration spaces
* Funding mechanisms
* Voting
* Composability
* Community currencies & micro-economies

--
## Bancor
* Traditionally the role of order book matching.
* Defines liquidity pools with token reserves

``$$
Price = \frac{\text{Reserve balance}}{\text{Token supply} * \text{Reserve ratio}}
$$``

Note:
* the point to understand, is that all bonding mechanisms, define a mathematical pricing relationship and some form of invariant

--
## Uniswap
* Is Uniswap a bonding curve? Not in a strict sense.
* Does it share some of the same properties? Yes.
* Defines a pricing relationship between the reserve of two ERC20 token pools.
* An "Automated Liquidity Provider"

``$$
x*y = k
$$``

`x` and `y` are reserve balance in a token pair, and k is the **invariant**!

See https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/

Note:
* larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones
* Uniswap applies a trade fee, which increases k, and pays out liquidity providers
* arbitrage acts to rebalance

## Trends
* Application of engineering methodology
* Introducing more degrees of freedom (e.g. risk-adjusted bonding curves)
* Introducing time as a variable (e.g. conviction voting)
* Using bonding curves as system interfaces (e.g. commons stack)
* Composability of bonding curves within modular systems
